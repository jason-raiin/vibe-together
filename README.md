### About

Currently, there are many apps and services that help visualise your Spotify data. However, these apps only work with either your own musical preferences, such as Spotify Wrapped and InstaFest, or your musical compatibility with one other individual, such as Spotify Blends or MusicTaste.

However, if a group of people want to compare their musical tastes as a group, it is extremely tedious to compare one by one, and there is currently no widely available service that can compare and visualise the common musical preferences of a group of people.

Our app aims to fill this niche, enabling people to discover their similarities and differences in musical preferences as a group.
